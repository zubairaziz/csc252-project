Group Number: 25

Zubair Ab Aziz - 106
Kennedy Agusi - 40
Zi Qing Liang - 101
Gazi Mahir Ahmed Naven - 21


For this projct, the work was split up between Zubair, Zi, and Naven because Kennedy has an medical emergency
and is still hospitalized. However he did create a fully functional web based RESTFul Service API for our project.
Most of Part B implementation was completed by Zubair because of his skills in PHP and HTML whereas Zi and Naven
helped with the design. Part A was contributed by Zi and Part D was mostly completed by Naven. Part C was contributed
by both Naven and Zi. Zubair did alot of double checking for this project as well. Kennedy has expressed his regret 
of not being able to help. We completely understand and wish him to feel better soon. His contribution and skills in
PHP and HTML shall be helpful for the next Milestone. We are fully aware of his situation and that his health is more
important. Therefore we hope that he will not receive any penalty.
