### Problem Statement:

We are trying to solve the problem where students and professors need to agree upon a time for an appointment, either for office hours or advising. Our “app” will help both parties to select times when they are free and available to meet. When there is a match, an appointment can be made. Using a database, it is much more easier to store a lot of information and pull out information that is necessary for certain users. It is also provides much more flexibility to the professors and students if they want to modify their availabilities. In a excel file, it would be much harder to track the appointments being made, as storing all the required information would make it messy and difficult to find information that we need in different situations.

### Example:

A student wants to set up an appointment with his/her department advisor. He/she can sign up an account for this app. He/she will need to provide information such as Student ID, Name, Email. After that, he/she will have the access to see every professor-user’s availabilities (provided by the professors themselves) and so to pick who he/she wants to meet with. One professor is only allowed to meet with one student at a time. The student is able to select the ideal available meeting date/time that matches with his/her schedule. After the student has chosen an available time slot and successfully submitted the appointment request, it will show on both the student’s and professor’s dashboard. Status of the appointment can be modified by the student and the professor.

### Future Work:

We will include more graphical methods in the UI/UX for both professors and students. For instance, professors will be able to use a calendar like graphical user interface that allows them to click on the particular time under a day. Professors will be able to use the same interface to later add more availability and delete availabilities. Students similarly will be able to access a similar calendar like user interface for a given week when they select a professor they would like to schedule an appointment with.

We will also include a notification system, both in-app and via email, which will let the professors and students know when an appointment has been scheduled. Any changes made by either the professor or student on deleting the appointment will also be notified. The in-app notifications will be added to the navbar and dashboard(homepage).

We also wish to include a functionality for both professors and students to check their past appointments and relevant details that come along with it.
